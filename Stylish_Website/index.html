              <em>Country:</em> <b>INDIA</b>
                  <p>Perhaps the most complete batsman and the most worshipped cricketer in the world,
                    Tendulkar holds just about every batting record worth owning in the game,
                    including those for most runs and hundreds in Tests and ODIs, and most
                    international runs.</p>

              <em>Country:</em> <b>INDIA</b>
              <p>Rahul Dravid was probably one of the last classical Test match batsmen. His progress
                 into the national side may have been steady and methodical rather than meteoric, but
                 once there, Dravid established himself at the vanguard of a new, defiant generation
                 that were no longer easybeats away from home. Armed with an orthodox technique drilled
                  into him by Keki Tarapore, he became the cement that held the foundations firm while
                  the flair players expressed themselves.</p>

              <h4>RICKY PONTING</h4>
              <em>Country:</em> <b>AUSTRALIA</b>
              <p>Ricky Ponting, the most uncompromising player of his generation, grew into Australia's
                most successful run-maker and only sits below Bradman in the country's overall ratings.
                 It takes an extremely critical eye to diminish his run-scoring achievements, which seem
                 to collect new records in every series. Like spotting a celebrity, it's necessary to look
                  twice when analysing Ponting, first as the archetypal modern batsman, then as the country's
                 42nd Test captain. There is no doubt about his greatness after taking guard, but his
                 leadership has been under scrutiny for much of his reign.</p>

            <em>Country:</em> <b>PAKISTAN</b>
                <p>Perhaps the best left-arm fast bowler of all time, Wasim Akram could make
                   the ball walk and talk like no one else did. An explosive, exciting genius
                   who could change the game with the bat as well.</p>

            <h4>ANIL KUMBLE</h4>
            <em>Country:</em> <b>INDIA</b>
            <p>No bowler in history won India more Test matches than Anil Kumble, and there
              probably hasn't been a harder trier either. Like the great tall wristspinners
              Bill O'Reilly and his own idol BS Chandrasekhar, Kumble traded the legspinner's
              proverbial yo-yo for a spear, as the ball hacked through the air rather than hanging in it and came off the pitch with a kick rather than a kink. </p>

            <em>Country:</em> <b>AUSTRALIA</b>
            <p>An express bowler whose career has consisted of Himalayan peaks and oceanic troughs,
               Mitchell Johnson at his best was as fearsome as fast bowlers come. That summit came
                during 2013-14, when in successive series he cowed the batsmen of England and South
                Africa with his speed and aggression. In those eight Tests he collected 59 wickets
                 at 15.23, along with a big bunch of cherries on helmets and gloves.</p>
